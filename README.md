# UML-Gerrymandering

1. expanding test suite

    a. Work through nan issues in computation of different metrics
    
        i. Analyze maps that yield nan values
        ii. Reimplement anything in the base redist package?
        
    b. Confidence intervals for kl divergence metrics, kde density estimation
    
        i. Discrete kl divergence function?
2. getting more technical in the discussion of our algorithm and thinking about how we can beef that up, 

    a. Improve python code via any optimizations possible
    
        - Optimization ideas go here
    b. Write in algorithmic package and provide algorithm runtime
    
    c. Practical and theoretical (if any) results
    
        - State space being reachable?
    d. reworking the intro to get rid of some fluff, 
    
3. expanding related literature section, 

4. Ask about publishing and what we need to improveâ€¦ other stuff

5. EAAMO Specifics

    a. Read through formatting and citation guidelines and implement them
    
    b. Read through past years papers to guide relevant editing and problem motivation
